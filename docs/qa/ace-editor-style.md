# Ace Editor Styling QA Checklist

This document lists the steps for verifying that Ace editor instances are styled consistently throughout the app.

1. Navigate to any feature that displays a code editor.
2. Confirm that the editor is inside a container with the `.code-editor` class.
3. Verify the container has a thin border and uses the same background color as the main menu.
4. Ensure code text appears in a monospace font and is legible.
5. Resize the editor to check that width and height remain consistent.

Report any styling deviations to the development team.
